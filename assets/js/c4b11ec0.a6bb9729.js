I can surely say that if there wasn\u2019t <strong>refine</strong> then the same project I have built would take me more than a month and there would be the involvement of maybe 2 or 3 individuals. Best wishes to the <strong>refine</strong> team."},"contents":[{"question":"Before you found refine, what problems were you facing?","answer":["State management in react and also creating an admin panel <strong>from scratch every time</strong> we start a project."]},{"question":"Which alternatives did you stay between and continue with refine?","answer":["At first, I knew about react admin to create a dashboard and gave it a try. But rather than solving my problem efficiently, it took me longer to understand the framework."]},{"question":"Which features and integrations have you been using and why?","answer":["I am using <strong>Ant Design</strong> with <strong>refine</strong> for creating a dashboard as Ant Design doesn\u2019t have any paid plan for their data table as of MUI. And also without having to write any CSS I have created a beautiful and stunning dashboard with no time just using the <strong>refine-antd</strong> package provided by <strong>refine</strong> team."]},{"question":"What aspects of refine do you like and dislike?","answer":["The aspect I like most is <strong>refine</strong> being <strong>headless by design</strong>. And also the documentation is very well structured with all sorts of example a user need. The most I like about refine is the <strong>amazing refine community on discord where we get help instantly</strong> whenever we are stuck with a problem, thanks to the awesome <strong>refine</strong> team."]}],"assets":[{"type":"image","url":"https://picsum.photos/seed/gravity/1600/900"},{"type":"image","url":"https://picsum.photos/seed/gravity-1/1600/900"},{"type":"image","url":"https://picsum.photos/seed/gravity-2/1600/900"}]}')}}]);
